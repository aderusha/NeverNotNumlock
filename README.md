> NUMLOCK IS THE DUMBEST KEY AND I HATE IT AND NOW I HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT

If you have a 101/104/etc-key keyboard it should probably be a 100/103/etc-key keyboard because the Num Lock key serves zero purpose other than to annoy me when for some reason isn't enabled and I want to type a number like a normal person but no instead I now have an extra set of cursor keys IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO MY EXISTING SET OF CURSOR KEYS.

If you have fingers and a keyboard I'm sure you'll agree, Num Lock is great but having a button to turn it off is not great.  It's not great at all.  In fact, it's actively awful.  You know when Num Lock should not be on I ask rhetorically? *NEVER* I answer a little to loudly for the people around me.
